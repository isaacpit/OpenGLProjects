Note:
I had several compiler warning pertaining to my #includes particularly the glm 
include. There were about 20 warning each describing "anonymous structs are a GNU extension [-Wgnu-anonymous-struct] struct { T x, y, z, w; };".
However other than those warnings I do not believe there were any others.
