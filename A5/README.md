# Keyframed Animation

Created a keyframed animation of a toy helicopter. 

Keyframes are interpolated using spline curves for translation and rotation. The arc length parametrization for constant flight speed is togglable. Also the camera view can be toggled to follow the helicopter or be in interactive mode.
